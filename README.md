# Cli-Quiz Intro

I wanted to knock this out in a day to solve a problem I had no time budgeted for. Python was the perfect option but I'm a n00b to it, so be cruel.

The other quizzes I use, like Anki-droid and Udemy quizzes are not open-source-ish enough. There is some difficulty adding question sets and types. I want questions in a data format that is more verifiable and standard.

We all need to learn, so maybe we can learn to trade.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Colorize questions
* [ ] Minutes left instead of a deadline
* [ ] Add several quizzes and expand questions.
